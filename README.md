# Improving gradient descent code to find Death Valley and Dead Sea in DEM using ADAM
### Final project for optimization class (MATH 693A)

Project Goal: Building off an existing code that searches for global minimum elevation from a digital elevation grid using steepest descent, I will apply an Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) algorithm to speed up the code and find an optimal step length for each iteration. Specifically, I will apply my finalized algorithm to DEMs to locate Death Valley and Dead Sea.
