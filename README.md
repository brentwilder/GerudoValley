# Finding minumum of Dead Sea using modified gradient descent algorthim 
### Final project for optimization class (MATH 693A)

Project Goal: Building off an existing code that searches for global minimum elevation from a digital elevation grid using steepest descent, I will apply an Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) algorithm to speed up the code and find an optimal step length for each iteration. Specifically, I will apply my finalized algorithm to the Dead Sea to find the global minimum for Earthâ€™s surface.
